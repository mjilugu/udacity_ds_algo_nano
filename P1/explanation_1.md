# Problem 1 - Least Recently Used Cache

This LRU cache uses a dictionary to store entries. Each entry
consists of an object with value and age field. Age is initialized at the time of instantiation of the cache and each object gets the current value of age at the time they are added to the cache before it is incremented.
The efficiency of both get() and set() is O(1)

# Problem 2 - File Recursion

The function find_files(suffix, path) recursively searches for files with given suffix under path. At each directory level we search the directory entries, repeating the search if entry is a directory. 
This algorithm will visit every sub path once for an efficiency of O(N)
